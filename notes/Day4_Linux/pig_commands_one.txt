before running this program,
If you are running the pig commands from grunt shell on hadoop cluster, set the property: 

set opt.fetch false;

By setting the above property dump will run in mapreduce mode, by default the above property is set to true.


grunt> cat myscript.pig
a = LOAD 'student' AS (name, age, gpa);
b = LIMIT a 3;
DUMP b;

grunt> exec myscript.pig
